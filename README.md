# ÔøΩ Graduation Card & Guestbook Web App ‚ú®

An interactive graduation invitation & guestbook platform. Create a personalized invitation space, manage a guest list with images, collect heartfelt messages in a flip‚Äëbook style guestbook, and share custom links for each guest. Secure authentication, JWT-based sessions, and email flows support a smooth experience for both hosts and invitees.

---

## Features

### üìù Host (User) Features
- Guest management (create, edit, delete guests; batch delete; attach multiple images per guest).
- Custom invitation pages per guest via route: `/invite/<username>/<nickname>` (underscores in nickname become spaces).
- Manage guestbook entries you authored (add, edit, delete) with optional image.
- View full guestbook in animated flip‚Äëbook interface.
- Personal profile & basic account settings (email verified before full access).

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Guest (Public) Features
- Access invitation page via shared link (no login needed for viewing).
- Submit a guestbook entry (message + optional image) directly to the host‚Äôs book.
- Browse previously submitted guestbook pages.

### ÔøΩ Guestbook Experience
- Flip‚Äëbook UI (powered by `react-pageflip`) paginates entries (2 entries per sheet) with cover & closing page.
- Auto image preview and removal before submission.
- Chronological rendering (oldest first for narrative flow).

### üîê Authentication & Security
- Email + password registration with uniqueness & validation.
- Email verification via code + confirm token.
- JWT access & refresh token pair (refresh endpoint provided).
- Logout invalidates active access token (blacklisting / revocation support).
- Password complexity & length validation.

### üì§ Media Handling
- Image uploads for guests & guestbook entries (processed from multipart form data).
- Pluggable storage layer (Firebase helper integration present in backend utilities).

## üîß Technologies Used

### Frontend
- ‚öõÔ∏è React (Vite toolchain)
- React Router DOM (dynamic invitation & dashboard routes)
- Context-based Auth state management
- Axios (API client abstraction in `services/`)
- `react-pageflip` (interactive book animation)
- Modern CSS modules / component styles

### Backend
- ÔøΩ Flask (REST API & blueprints per domain)
- SQLAlchemy ORM & Alembic migrations
- JWT-based auth (custom middleware `JWT_required`)
- Dependency Injection container (`core/di_container.py` + `AppConfig/di_setup.py`)
- Email templating (HTML + TXT) for verification & password reset
- Optional Celery/RabbitMQ scaffold (present, can be enabled for async emailing)
- Firebase helper integration for object storage (images)

### Data
- Relational database (designed for guest, guestbook, user, role, token, blacklist, login attempt entities)

## üåç System Architecture

![System Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

High-level request flow:
1. Client (React SPA) issues JSON or multipart requests.
2. Flask blueprints route to Controller classes (Auth / Invitation / GuestBook / User / Health).
3. Controllers delegate to Services for business logic (validation, orchestration, token lifecycle, upload coordination).
4. Services rely on Repositories (encapsulating SQLAlchemy models & queries) for persistence.
5. DI container wires concrete repositories & services at startup (`AppConfig/di_setup.py`).
6. Middleware validates JWT & injects `user_id` into protected requests.
7. Responses are serialized via model `as_dict()` helpers; localized messages embedded where required.
8. (On proccessing) Async tasks (e.g., large email batches) can be offloaded to Celery workers when enabled.

Image/file handling enters via multipart form endpoints (guests, guestbook) ‚Üí service layer ‚Üí storage helper ‚Üí persistent URLs saved in DB.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python ‚â• 3.9
- PostgreSQL (connection string for SQLAlchemy)
- (Optional) RabbitMQ + Celery if enabling async workers
- Firebase project (if using remote image storage) or local storage fallback
- Node.js (for client)

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phongnickchinh/Graduation-card-react-flask.git
cd Graduation-card-react-flask
```

### Backend Setup (`server/`)
```bash
cd server
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# Or: source venv/bin/activate  (macOS/Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Copy `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env` and fill values:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:port/db
JWT_SECRET=...
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=...
EMAIL_SENDER=...
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=...
# etc.
```
Run migrations:
```bash
flask db upgrade
```
Start API:
```bash
python run.py
```

### (Optional) Celery Worker
```bash
celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
```

### Frontend Setup (`client/`)
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Client dev server defaults (Vite) to a localhost port (e.g., 5173). Configure API base URL in environment (`.env`, `.env.example`).

## Run Application Using Docker Compose (Not ready)
<!-- This project currently does not include a `docker-compose.yml` in the repository root. To containerize, create one that wires:
* Flask API + environment (.env)
* PostgreSQL service (with volume)
* (Optional) RabbitMQ + Celery worker
* React build (served via Nginx) or dev container

Placeholder example snippet (not yet committed):
```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
   api:
      build: ./server
      env_file: ./server/.env
      ports:
         - "5000:5000"
      depends_on:
         - db
   db:
      image: postgres:15
      environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: user
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
         POSTGRES_DB: gradcard
      volumes:
         - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
   # worker & frontend services can be added similarly
volumes:
   db_data:
```
Add such a file then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
``` -->

## üîÑ Usage
1. Register an account & verify email (receive code, call verify endpoint via UI).
2. Log in ‚Üí redirected to your dashboard (guest management route).
3. Create guests (optional images). Share personalized invitation link.
4. View guestbook: flip through pages; toggle add form on last page.
5. Public visitors submit messages/images without logging in (by username route) ‚Äî entries appear in book.
6. Edit or delete your guestbook entries / guests as needed.
7. Logout to invalidate current access token (refresh requires stored refresh token).
